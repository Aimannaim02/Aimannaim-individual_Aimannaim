My nickname is Aiman or you can also call me Eman hehe😗 I was born on 14th April 2002, making me 20years old this year (2022). I was born in Jitra, Kedah which is at Hospital Jitra.

My hobby is to listening to music🎵🎶 my fav genre is more to Pop and K-pop. I also like ballad song. Besides, my other hobby is scrolling tiktok wkwkwk🤭 Oh ya... Just to tell yall about myself, I am an introvert person. I don't really like to be in a crowded situation. I rarely talk to others but I talk often talking and laughing with my comfort circle🙂 but I'm okay. That's maybe a problem to me to face a few situation but I can't to stay like that. I need to out of my comfort zone. So yeah maybe that can be as a practice to me to be more socialize. I think that's all about me i guess. So, if you are interested in knowing me more, do have a look around my website heheh😍</p>
