<p class="p1" style="text-align:center;color:DarkSlateGray"><span style="cursor:default">Hello! See you again HAHAHðŸ¤­ this time I will share about my experience.</p>
<h3 id="Lived in a dormitory for 11 years">1) Lived in a dormitory for 11 years.</h3>
<p>I used to live in a dormitory when I was still in primary school at the age of 11. You must be wondering why I entered a dormitory so young hehe. I was selected to be one of 60 people to be part of the government assistance program which is  Program Koridor Utara. I got a lot of help from each other there.</p>

<h3 id="Participate in sports"><p><b> 2) Participate in sports.</b></p></h3>
<p>During form 1, I joined a petanque club at school. At first, I knew nothing about the sport and never knew at all. Until I tried to play with my teacher. I became interested and played regularly. One time, I was just excited to participate in the competition at the state level. Unexpectedly I made it to the semi -finals. Since then, I often participated in it until I got the first place at the Perlis state level after 3 years of training.</p>

<h3 id="Experience working in an office"><p><b> 3) Experience working in an office.</b></p></h3>
<p>Last semester, I had to undergo industrial training during the semester break. I chose to undergo industrial training at the library at UUM. There, I could feel the atmosphere of working in the office and gained a lot of experience while trying on every part of the library. I learned many things while undergoing industrial training</p>
